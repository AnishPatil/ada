Below is a shell script that uses XFOIL to analyze a NACA 2412 airfoil at 3 degrees angle of attack, a Reynolds number of 1e7, a Mach number of 0.2, a trip on the upper suface located at 0.9 normalized chord, and a lower surface trip at 0.95 of normalized chord.  A log amplification factor (N or Ncrit) is set to 9.0.  The maximum iteration count is set to 100.  A total of 160 panels are used to define the airfoil geometry.  Pressure coefficient data is dumped to a file named 'cp_data.txt' and boundary layer data is dumped to a file named 'bl_data.txt'.  Coefficients of lift, drag, and moment are dumped to a file named 'polars.txt'.
